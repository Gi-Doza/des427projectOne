# P5: Etch A Sketch  
**By: Gian Mendoza**  

## Project Overview  
P5: Etch A Sketch is a digital recreation of the **classic Etch A Sketch** toy, built using **p5.js**. The project challenges users to draw within constraints—allowing only **vertical and horizontal lines**—providing both entertainment and a creative challenge.  

### **How It Works**  
- **Click anywhere** on the canvas to set a starting point.  
- Use **W / S** to move **up/down**.  
- Use **← / →** to move **left/right**.  
- Hold keys for **continuous drawing**.  
- Press **Delete / Backspace** to clear the canvas.
